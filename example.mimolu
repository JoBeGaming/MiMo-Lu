@ This is an example

a -> 1; @ A comment
b -> "two"; @ Valid types are: integers, strings, arrays
c -> [a, b, 3]; @ Arrays can contain multiple values
d -> 1, "two", c; @ This is just another way to create arrays
e, f, g -> 1, [a, b, 4], "five"; @ And here we assign multiple values to multiple variables
